Still no clue, but I'm able to build a scene with layers and collisions and even move a guy around a screen...animated!!!

Still no clue, and at times I feel like I know less than yesterday....there is a tremendous amound of paralysis by over load in this world. There are so many little things to take care of, for every little scene, it is REALLY hard to try and even get started...where do you begin when faced with a mountain a mini chaos...???? The answer is, it doesn't matter...just don't sit still....always moving forward!!!!

I'm getting the hang of a few things, but nothing concrete yet. I've got a bunch of little bits and bobs but I need to get them all together into a whole. One simple level...right!!

Learning to use animation player. It's ok, but a bit finicky. I don't really know how to use it so I often delete things.
I do have a bunch of animations now though, and understand how and where to get them...now to see if we can call them.
